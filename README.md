# AXI4-Compliant Memory SystemVerilog Design

ðŸš€ **Project Title:** AXI4 Memory-Mapped Slave with SystemVerilog Verification Environment

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a simplified **AMBA AXI4-compliant memory system**, designed in **SystemVerilog** and verified using a **coverage-driven verification** methodology. It models a 4KB word-addressable memory that interacts with an AXI4 master through a compliant slave interface, supporting **burst-based read/write transactions**.

The design is compliant with core AXI4 protocol features including:
- Separate address/control and data phases
- Burst transactions (via AWLEN/ARLEN)
- 4KB boundary enforcement
- READY/VALID handshaking
- Write responses and error signaling

## ðŸ§© Design Modules

- **axi4_slave**: AXI4 slave interface that interprets burst read/write transactions and enforces protocol rules.
- **axi4_memory**: Single-port synchronous RAM (4KB, 1024 Ã— 32-bit words).

## âœ… Verification Environment

A complete **SystemVerilog UVM-like testbench** was developed, incorporating:
- **Transaction-level modeling** with SystemVerilog classes (`axi4_packet`, drivers, monitors, checkers)
- **Constrained-random stimulus generation** for all AXI4 signals
- **Interface-based design** with modports for clean signal handling
- **Functional coverage models** for burst lengths, sizes, boundary cases, and protocol behaviors
- **Assertion-based verification** using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)
- **Waveform inspection and log tracing** for debug

## ðŸŽ¯ Coverage Goals

- âœ… 100% Functional Coverage
- âœ… 100% Code Coverage (Line, Branch, Toggle, Condition)
- âœ… 100% Assertion Coverage

Uncovered bins, if any, are documented with clear justification in the report.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

- `*.sv` Design and Testbench Files
- `run.do` script for simulation automation (ModelSim/Questa)
- PDF report with:
  - Waveforms and test results
  - Coverage and assertion reports
  - Code snippets and log outputs

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Language:** SystemVerilog
- **Simulator:** QuestaSim / ModelSim
- **Methodology:** Functional Coverage + SVA
- **Target:** SoC / RTL Verification with AXI4 interface
