# XI4-Compliant-Memory-Mapped-Slave-Verification
This project implements a simplified AXI4 memory-mapped slave interface in SystemVerilog, designed to support and verify AXI4 burst-based read and write transactions. It includes a 4KB internal memory block and adheres to AXI4 protocol rules such as valid/ready handshakes, burst handling, and 4KB boundary compliance.
